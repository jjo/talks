# Programming the Linux Kernel, Rosario, AR 2000

My [1st talk ever about Linux Kernel Programming (in
Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iaV1F0qsPE), Rosario,
Argentina, 2000.

Sharing what I learned from [contributing IP Aliasing support to the
Linux Kernel](https://marc.info/?l=linux-net&m=90997113426964&w=3) <3.
